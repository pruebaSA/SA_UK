           offered at <a href="http://www.salonaddict.co.uk" target="_blank" >http://www.salonaddict.co.uk</a>. As used in this Agreement, "SalonAddict" refers to Salonaddict Ltd. 
           and "Salon" or "you" refers to you. USE OF THE SERVICES AND THE SALONADDICT SITE CONSTITUTES KNOWING 
           ACCEPTANCE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS USER AGREEMENT and SALONADDICT’S PRIVACY POLICY (the "Privacy Policy").
        </p>
        <p>
           SalonAddict may modify this Agreement's terms and conditions at any time without notice. Continued use of the 
           Services and the SalonAddict Site after a change in this Agreement, a change in the Privacy Policy, or after 
           implementation of any other new policy constitutes acceptance of such change or policy. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <div style="margin-bottom:8px;" ><b>1. WHAT WE DO</b></div>
           SalonAddict will provide Salons with the ability to access information relating to the Services provided 
           by SalonAddict to the Salon.
        </p>
        <p>
           <div style="margin-bottom:8px;" ><b>2. PRIVACY POLICY</b></div>
           SalonAddict is committed to safeguarding the privacy of the users of SalonAddict's websites and mobile 
           applications. Please review our Privacy Policy. Each Salon agrees to follow our Privacy Policy and not 
           to take any actions in conflict with our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
           <div style="margin-bottom:8px;" ><b>3. USAGE GUIDELINES AND WARRANTIES</b></div>
           Each Salon will be allowed to create Salon User(s) (each, a "User") to access the SalonAddict 
           Reservation Widget. Each Salon and its User(s) warrants and covenants such User has the authority 
           to view and manage the Salon's confidential information as posted on<br /><a href="http://www.salonaddict.co.uk" target="_blank" >http://www.salonaddict.co.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Each User must first engage with a representative of SalonAddict Ltd. to request a User account. 
           Such User then will follow each prompt to enable SalonAddict to verify certain private information in 
           relation to the Salon. Such User must have a verifiable, working email address in order to proceed with 
           the registration process.
        </p>
        <p>
           SalonAddict will then provide to the Salon a link located on the Salon’s Reservation Widget which will allow 
           each User to access the account. Each User is responsible for keeping the password confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
           After initial registration, a User may request user access for other Salon employees, agents or employees 
           from other related Salons. This procedure is initiated by those seeking to access a user account and can 
           only be approved by a designated User.
        </p>
        <p>
           SalonAddict is not responsible for dissemination of additional user access, as all requests for additional 
           user access must be routed to a designated User. SalonAddict is also not responsible for the management of 
           additional user access for Salon users who are no longer employees or agents of the Salon.
        </p>
        <p>
           SalonAddict will only have the ability to reset and email temporary passwords for accounts created 
           on <a href="http://www.salonaddict.co.uk" target="_blank" >http://www.salonaddict.co.uk</a>. You may contact +353 (0)1 2938827 for additional limited assistance 
           relating to your User account.
